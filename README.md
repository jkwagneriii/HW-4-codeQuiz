# HW-4-codeQuiz
This is a homework assignment using JavaScript to create a timed quiz.

When you click the start button, the timer will begin counting down and you will recieve your first question. Each question will follow. Be careful! Don't try to memorize the order because the questions will display randomy each time you take the quiz.

I started by creating my skeleton HTML page with a little CSS. I know the CSS doesn't need to be a priority at the start, but having stuff look a little bit prettier helps me visualize the logic as well.

I began making my startGame function with vanilla JavaScript, but during my tutor sessions we implemented jQuery. I then found out the next day in class we aren't supposed to use jQuery on this assignment, but since I spent a good 3 hours getting it to work I figured I would keep it and try to tackle some other problems.

I'm struggling on how to connect the button the user presses with a correct or incorrect answer. I've written out functions and objects and can't seem to make them link up. I'm hoping this will click during the project and I can come back to resubmit that for this HW. 

This assignment is for sure incomplete, but I tried to accomplish small goals and actually understand them. When the wall I hit was too frustrating, I figured at this stage it's better for me to stop working on the homework and instead work on some lessons. So that's where I'm at for now.
