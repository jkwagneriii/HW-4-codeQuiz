When the webpage loads, I could use a navbar element to have a link on the upper left hand corner to an external html document called highscore.html. On the right side of the navbar there will be a countdown timer. I have put some possible reference code for this in the reference.js page. 
There will be the main div that contains the opening <h1> title, with a <p> explaining the game, with a start button underneath that. When the start button is clicked, the event will launch the function that makes the timer start and the game run.
Then there will be an element in the center of the page. It will probably be a div. The div will contain an <h1> that will will display an individual question. Under the <h1> there could be a <ul> element that uses <li> to display the buttons with each possible answer. 
IF you click an answer and get it wrong, a 'wrong' message will display and the timer will, for an instant, decrease by 3 seconds instead of 1. Then the next question will appear. IF you get the answer right, it will display 'correct!' and the next question will appear. 
Each answer, correct or wrong, will be stored in a global score variable. That will display at the end of the quiz, along with how many seconds the user had remaining on their countdown timer.
The highscore html will have a div that displays the top 5 scores. To earn a spot at the top you need the most correct answers as well as the most amount of time left on the clock. No freaking clue how to make that comparison yet.

Toggle Logic???
PSUEDO WITH THE CLASS 

1. Use toggle logic to start quiz and timer.
2. Get the quiz timer to start (set interval)
3. Have question array start (for loop) questions.length


----------------------------------------------------------------------



//1.) get questions to work first - reference: LookMaNoHTML VSCode, tip: appending into HTML
//2.) get the scores and other var's to work in suite
//3.) get the time to work
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Declare function .timeEL - call Jquary
//Declare function global var's - userscore, container, high-score, 
//Button with toggle(logic) to start quiz and timer.
//Quiz timer starts - setInterval(sumFunction, seconds*1000) 
//Declare sumFunction [array of object(s)] - questions, options, and/or [booleans]: Each question is an object, its on set of {}
//Append elements in array based on index
//Array starts - indentify for loop, i>x, i++. (doesnt have to be ">" symbol) Use == to have a True or false anwser.
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Declare global var: correct, wrong, container, highscore, time
// When webpage loads, want to see view highscores, timer, score, and intro page
// Declare toggle function to change intro to quiz display & trigger timer via start button
    // toggle .add("hide")/.remove("hide")
// Timer starts --> setInterval(someFunction, seconds*1000)
// Declare someFunction
    // Declare array of objects (rep questions) consisting of options & boolean
    // Loop through array --> for (var i=0; i<array.length; i++) {
        // One Question
        // Use If/else
        // userScore ++/-
