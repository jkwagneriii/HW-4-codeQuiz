When the webpage loads, I could use a navbar element to have a link on the upper left hand corner to an external html document called highscore.html. On the right side of the navbar there will be a countdown timer. I have put some possible reference code for this in the reference.js page. 
Then there will be an element in the center of the page. It will probably be a div. The div will contain an <h2> that will will display an individual question. Under the <h2> there could be a <ul> element that uses <li> to display the buttons with each possible answer. 
IF you click an answer and get it wrong, a 'wrong' message will display and the timer will, for an instant, decrease by 3 seconds instead of 1. Then the next question will appear. IF you get the answer right, it will display 'correct!' and the next question will appear. 
Each answer, correct or wrong, will be stored in a global score variable. That will display at the end of the quiz, along with how many seconds the user had remaining on their countdown timer.
The highscore html will have a div that displays the top 5 scores. To earn a spot at the top you need the most correct answers as well as the most amount of time left on the clock. No freaking clue how to make that comparison yet.
